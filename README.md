# L.U.N.A. - Lifestyle Utility & Nurturing Assistant

**LUNA Cares for You**

L.U.N.A. is a nurturing companion API that suggests daily outfits based on weather, with personalized, toggleable nudges to make users feel cared for. It uses FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and OpenWeatherMap to deliver a seamless experience. Built for the Boot.dev 2025 Hackathon.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in securely with JWT tokens (`/signup`, `/login`).
- **Weather-Based Outfit Recommendations**: Get personalized outfit suggestions based on city weather (`/recommendation`).
- **Customizable Preferences**: Users can set their location and toggle features on or off (`/preferences`).
- **Nudge History**: View past recommendations to revisit L.U.N.A.â€™s advice (`GET /nudges`).

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for API routes and logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLModel for user and nudge data.
- **Authentication**: `python-jose` for JWT tokens, `passlib` for password hashing.
- **External API**: OpenWeatherMap for real-time weather data.
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and deployment.
